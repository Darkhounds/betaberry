3 As a player I can chose a base value i want to bet and between 3 betting modes,
  1, 2, 3 or 4 slots, each having a higher risk/reward factor then the
  previous. The bet return is calculated by the formula:
   (base value x Difficulty x (Penalty || Bonus)) - base value

  randomized bidirectional board of 5x5 slots with:

  slots, 1, 2, 3 or 4 depending on the chosen mode, the bet ends and the return
  is calculated.
